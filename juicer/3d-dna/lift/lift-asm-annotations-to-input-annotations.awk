#### Description: Script to map 2D annotation files from a given assembly to the original input scaffolds/contigs according to a particular asm and cprops file.
#### Usage: awk -v scale=<scale> -f remap-asm-annotations-to-input-annotations.awk <cprops> <asm> <asm-annotation-file>
#### Input: Cprops file, asm file and 2D annotation file. Note that annotations are expected to be in the bed-like 0-based coordinate format (0-1000; 1000-2000; 2000-3000), 12-column assembly tab separated format.
#### WARNING: Works for diagonal annotations only at this point.
#### WARNING: Annotations are expected not to cross input scaffold/contig boundaries. TODO: add splitting by boundary into this script rather than handle it outside.
#### Output: 2D annotation file STDOUT in assembly 12-column tab separated format.
#### Parameters: parameter to scale coordinates in final output, can be both >1 (to squeeze the map) or <1 (to stretch the map out, default scale = 1). Never needed, kept just in case for cases when individual scaffolds are > 2.1 Gb.
#### Notes: In principle can take in parameters for fixed gap between individual contigs (cgap) and individual scaffolds (sgap), but not prompted. By default both are equal to 0.
#### TODO: Maybe change globalpos from being defined as a function of cprops entry to function of counter, safer..
